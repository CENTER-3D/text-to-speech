# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}}
{: #gettingStarted}

The {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechfull}} service converts written text to natural-sounding speech to provide speech-synthesis capabilities for applications. This curl-based tutorial can help you get started quickly with the service. The examples show you how to call the service's `POST` and `GET /v1/synthesize` methods to request an audio stream.
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

- {: hide-dashboard}  Create an instance of the service:
    1.  {: hide-dashboard} Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}}](https://{DomainName}/catalog/services/text-to-speech){: external} page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Catalog.
    1.  {: hide-dashboard} Sign up for a free {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account or log in.
    1.  {: hide-dashboard} Click **Create**.
-   Copy the credentials to authenticate to your service instance:
    1.  {: hide-dashboard} From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Resource list](https://{DomainName}/resources){: external}, click on your {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service instance to go to the {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} service dashboard page.
    1.  On the **Manage** page, click **Show** to view your credentials.
    1.  Copy the `API Key` and `URL` values.

### Using the curl examples
{: #getting-started-curl}

This tutorial uses the `curl` command to call methods of the service's HTTP interface. Make sure that you have the `curl` command installed on your system.

1.  To test whether `curl` is installed, run the following command on the command line. If the output lists the `curl` version that supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), you are set for the tutorial.

    ```bash
    curl -V
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  If necessary, install the version of `curl` with SSL enabled for your operating system from [curl.haxx.se](https://curl.haxx.se/){: external}.

Omit the braces from the examples. They indicate variable values.

## Step 1: Synthesize text in US English
{: #synthesizeEnglish}

The following commands use the `POST /v1/synthesize` method to synthesize US English input to audio files in two different formats. Both requests use the default US English voice, `en-US_MichaelVoice`.

1.  Issue the following command to synthesize the string "hello world" and produce a WAV file that is named `hello_world.wav`.
    -   {: hide-dashboard} Replace `{apikey}` and `{url}` with your API key and URL.

    *Windows users,* replace the backslash (`\`) at the end of each line with a caret (`^`). Make sure there are no trailing spaces.
    {: tip}

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey}"{: apikey} \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "Accept: audio/wav" \
    --data "{\"text\":\"hello world\"}" \
    --output hello_world.wav \
    "{url}/v1/synthesize"{: url}
    ```
    {: pre}

1.  Issue the following command to synthesize the same text but produce an Ogg file (the default format) that is named `hello_world.ogg`.
    -   {: hide-dashboard} Replace `{apikey}` and `{url}` with your API key and URL.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -u "apikey:{apikey}"{: apikey} \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data "{\"text\":\"hello world\"}" \
    --output hello_world.ogg \
    "{url}/v1/synthesize"{: url}
    ```
    {: pre}

You can use a browser or other tools to play the audio files that are produced by the examples in this tutorial. For more information, see [Playing an audio file](/docs/services/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-audioFormats#formatsPlay).
{: note}

## Step 2: Synthesize text in Spanish
{: #synthesizeSpanish}

The following command uses the `GET /v1/synthesize` method to synthesize Spanish input to an audio file.

1.  Issue the following command to synthesize the string "hola mundo" and produce a WAV file that is named `hola_mundo.wav`. The input text is URL-encoded. The method includes the query parameters `accept` to specify the audio format and `voice` to specify a Spanish voice, `es-ES_EnriqueVoice`.
    -   {: hide-dashboard} Replace `{apikey}` and `{url}` with your API key and URL.

    ```bash
    curl -X GET -u "apikey:{apikey}"{: apikey} \
    --output hola_mundo.wav \
    "{url}/v1/synthesize?accept=audio%2Fwav&text=hola%20mundo&voice=es-ES_EnriqueVoice"{: url}
    ```
    {: pre}
